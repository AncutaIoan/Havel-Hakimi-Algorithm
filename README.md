# Havel-Hakimi-Algorithm
This is an implementation of the [Havel-Hakimi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havel%E2%80%93Hakimi_algorithm), an algorithm that answers the question "Given a list of numbers, is it possible to construct a simple graph with a degree sequence which is precisely this list?".
